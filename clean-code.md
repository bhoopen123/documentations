Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do. “Donald Knuth”
Any fool can write the code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.   “Martin Fowler”
Clean coding practices don’t slow you down. You can be fast and clean in your development.
