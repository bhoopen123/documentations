## What is Microservices ?
Microservices is an architectural style where autonomous, independently deployable services colleborate to form an application or system.

#### How small should they be?
There isn't an official size limit, some teams try to keep extremely small but many of the benefits of microservices still apply event if they are bit larger. 

#### The problem of monoliths
- Single codebase
- Single process 
- Single host 
- Single database
- Consistent technology (one programming language or SDK)

#### Monolith Benefits
- Simplicity
- One codebase
    - easy to find things
    - straight forward for developer to work on
- Deployment
    - easy deployment as only one application to update

So, there is nothing wrong using developing Monolith applications

#### Monolith Problems
- Problem of scale
- Difficult to deploy
    - Risky
    - Requires downtime
