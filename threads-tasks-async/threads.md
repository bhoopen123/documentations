## CPU, Thread and Thread Scheduler
- A thread is a basic unit of work that a CPU can execute. In general a application will always have atleast one thread (aka `main thread`, `UI thread`, etc.).
- Thread scheduler is used to load thread in the CPU. It is responsible to assign a `Thread` to `CPU`.
    - `Thread Scheduler` will use Time Slicing approach to execute multiple Threads on CPU.
    - `Thread Scheduler` is the part of Operating System and out of the Developer Control.
- There is no direct intreaction between `Application` and `CPU`. `CPU` intreacts with `Thread` via `Thread Scheduler`.

### Critical Section of code
A critical section of code is the part of a program where shared resources (like variables, files, or memory) are accessed or modified.
- Only one thread should execute this section at a time to avoid race conditions.
- If multiple threads enter the critical section simultaneously, data corruption or inconsistent results can occur.

### Threads Synchronization
Threre are multiple ways to do threads synchronization

### Exclusive Lock
- An exclusive lock means only one thread can enter a critical section of code at a time.
- Other threads attempting to acquire the lock are blocked until the lock is released.
- This prevents race conditions and ensures thread safety when working with shared data.

- Syntex of `lock` in c#
```
lock (lockObject)
{
    // Critical section: only one thread can execute this at a time
}
```
- lockObject must be a reference type (commonly private readonly object).
- The runtime uses Monitor.Enter and Monitor.Exit under the hood to manage the lock.

- Example

```
class Counter
{
    private int count = 0;
    private readonly object lockObj = new object();

    public void Increment()
    {
        lock (lockObj)
        {
            count++;
            Console.WriteLine($"Count: {count}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Monitor
- `Monitor.Enter` is part of the System.Threading.Monitor class.
- It provides exclusive locking for a block of code, just like `lock`.
- When a thread calls `Monitor.Enter(obj)`, it acquires a lock on `obj`.
- Other threads trying to enter with the same object are blocked until the lock is released.

- Example, 

```
object lockObj = new object();

Monitor.Enter(lockObj);
try
{
    // Critical section
    Console.WriteLine("Thread-safe work here");
}
finally
{
    // Always release the lock
    Monitor.Exit(lockObj);
}
```

#### Key Points
- You must always pair `Monitor.Enter` with `Monitor.Exit`.
- The `try/finally` ensures the lock is released even if an exception occurs.
- Forgetting `Monitor.Exit` can cause deadlocks.


- `TryEnter` lets you attempt to acquire a lock with a timeout. Useful when you don’t want threads to wait indefinitely.

- Example, 

```
object lockObj = new object();

if (Monitor.TryEnter(lockObj, 1000)) // wait up to 1 second
{
    try
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Lock acquired");
    }
    finally
    {
        Monitor.Exit(lockObj);
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Could not acquire lock");
}
```

- Use lock for most cases — it’s cleaner and safer.
- Use Monitor.Enter when you need advanced control:
  - Timeouts (TryEnter)
  - Signaling between threads (Wait, Pulse)
  - More complex synchronization patterns

### Mutex
A `Mutex` is a synchronization primitive that can be used across multiple processes, while a `lock` (keyword) is limited to threads within the same process. `Mutex` is heavier and slower because it relies on the operating system kernel, whereas `lock` is faster and simpler since it’s just syntactic sugar over `Monitor`.

- A Mutex (short for Mutual Exclusion) is an object that ensures only one thread or process can access a resource at a time.
- Works across multiple processes, not just within a single application.
- Slower than lock because it involves kernel-level operations.

- Example
```
Mutex mutex = new Mutex();
mutex.WaitOne();   // Acquire the mutex
// Critical section
mutex.ReleaseMutex(); // Release the mutex
```

- Example 1: Basic Mutex in a Single Process
Even though lock is usually enough inside one process, you can still use a Mutex:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static Mutex mutex = new Mutex();

    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            Thread t = new Thread(Worker);
            t.Start(i);
        }
    }

    static void Worker(object id)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} waiting for Mutex...");
        mutex.WaitOne(); // Acquire
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} entered critical section.");
        Thread.Sleep(1000); // Simulate work
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} leaving critical section.");
        mutex.ReleaseMutex(); // Release
    }
}
```

Output: 
```text
Thread 0 waiting for Mutex...
Thread 0 entered critical section.
Thread 1 waiting for Mutex...
Thread 0 leaving critical section.
Thread 1 entered critical section.
```

👉 Only one thread at a time enters the critical section.

🧩 Example 2: Named Mutex Across Processes
This is where Mutex shines compared to lock. You can synchronize different applications.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Named Mutex (system-wide)
        using (Mutex mutex = new Mutex(false, "Global\\MyAppMutex"))
        {
            if (!mutex.WaitOne(0, false))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Another instance is already running!");
                return;
            }

            Console.WriteLine("Running... Press Enter to exit.");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

Scenario:
- Run this program twice.
- The second instance will detect the first one and exit with the message:
"Another instance is already running!"
👉 This is a common technique to prevent multiple instances of an application.

🧩 Example 3: Timeout with Mutex
You can set a timeout when waiting for a Mutex.

```csharp
if (mutex.WaitOne(2000)) // Wait for 2 seconds
{
    try
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Acquired Mutex!");
        // Work here
    }
    finally
    {
        mutex.ReleaseMutex();
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Could not acquire Mutex within 2 seconds.");
}
```
👉 Useful when you don’t want threads to block indefinitely.

👉 If you forget to release, the Mutex stays locked, causing deadlocks.

⚖️ When to Use Mutex
- Use lock for thread synchronization inside one process (faster, simpler).
- Use Mutex when:
  - You need cross-process synchronization.
  - You want to prevent multiple instances of an app.
  - You need OS-level synchronization objects.

### Reader and Writer Lock
`ReaderWriterLockSlim` in C# is a thread synchronization technique that allows multiple threads to read concurrently while ensuring only one thread can write at a time on a shared resource. It improves performance compared to a simple lock when reads are frequent and writes are rare.

🔑 What is ReaderWriterLockSlim?
- Designed for multithreaded environments where shared resources are accessed by multiple readers and occasional writers.
- Key advantage: Multiple readers can access simultaneously, but writers get exclusive access.
- Supports UpgradeableReadLock: a thread can start with read access and later upgrade to write access without releasing the lock.

⚙️ Lock Modes

| Lock Mode | Purpose |
|---------- | -------- | 
| EnterReadLock() | Multiple threads can read concurrently. |
| EnterWriteLock() | Only one thread can write; blocks readers and other writers. |
 EnterUpgradeableReadLock() | Allows a thread to read, but later upgrade to write if needed. |
| ExitReadLock() / ExitWriteLock() | Releases the lock after use. |

📖 Example 1: Basic Reader/Writer

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    private static ReaderWriterLockSlim rwLock = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();
    private static string sharedData = "Initial Value";

    static void Reader()
    {
        rwLock.EnterReadLock();
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Reader Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId} read: {sharedData}");
        }
        finally
        {
            rwLock.ExitReadLock();
        }
    }

    static void Writer()
    {
        rwLock.EnterWriteLock();
        try
        {
            sharedData = $"Updated by Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}";
            Console.WriteLine(sharedData);
        }
        finally
        {
            rwLock.ExitWriteLock();
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(Reader);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(Writer);
        Thread t3 = new Thread(Reader);

        t1.Start();
        t2.Start();
        t3.Start();
    }
}
```

👉 Here, multiple readers can run simultaneously, but the writer blocks them until it finishes.

⚠️ Risks & Best Practices

- Always release locks in finally blocks to avoid deadlocks.

- Prefer `ReaderWriterLockSlim` over `ReaderWriterLock` (older class) because it’s faster and avoids common deadlock scenarios.

Use when reads dominate writes; otherwise, a simple lock may be more efficient.

✅ In short: Use ReaderWriterLockSlim when you have frequent reads and occasional writes to shared data. It boosts performance by allowing concurrent readers while still protecting against race conditions.

### Semaphore / SemaphoreSlim
A `Semaphore` in C# is a thread synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource by limiting the number of threads that can enter a critical section at the same time. Unlike a `lock` (which allows only one thread), a semaphore can allow N threads concurrently.

- Maintains a count of how many threads can access a resource simultaneously.
- When the count reaches zero, additional threads are blocked until another thread releases the semaphore.
- Useful for resource pools (like database connections, file handles, or limited hardware resources).


#### Types of Semaphores
 - Semaphore : Can be shared across processes. 
 - SemaphoreSlim: Lightweight, faster, but limited to threads within the same process. 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    // Allow max 3 threads at a time
    private static Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3, 3);

    static void Worker(int id)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} waiting...");
        semaphore.WaitOne(); // Acquire
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} entered.");
            Thread.Sleep(2000); // Simulate work
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread {id} leaving.");
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphore.Release(); // Release
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++)
        {
            new Thread(() => Worker(i)).Start();
        }
    }
}
```

👉 Output shows only 3 threads run at once, others wait until a slot is free.


Using SemaphoreSlim
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    private static SemaphoreSlim semaphoreSlim = new SemaphoreSlim(2); // allow 2 threads

    static async Task Worker(int id)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Worker {id} waiting...");
        await semaphoreSlim.WaitAsync(); // async acquire
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Worker {id} entered.");
            await Task.Delay(1000); // simulate async work
            Console.WriteLine($"Worker {id} leaving.");
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphoreSlim.Release();
        }
    }

    static async Task Main()
    {
        var tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(i => Worker(i));
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    }
}
```

👉 SemaphoreSlim is ideal for async/await scenarios in modern C# applications.

⚠️ Best Practices
- Always release the semaphore in a finally block to avoid deadlocks.
- Use SemaphoreSlim for in-process scenarios (faster, supports async).
- Use Semaphore when you need cross-process synchronization.
- Don’t set the count too high—otherwise it defeats the purpose of limiting access.

✅ In short: Semaphores are perfect when you want to allow multiple threads (but not unlimited) to access a resource at the same time.
Would you like me to also show a real-world example (like controlling access to a database connection pool)?
